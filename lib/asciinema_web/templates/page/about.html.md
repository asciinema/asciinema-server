# About asciinema

asciinema (formerly ascii.io) is a free and open source solution for
recording terminal sessions and sharing them on the web.

It aims to be a "go to" place for every command-line user who wants to share
their skills with others. Or putting it differently, it's a place to show off
your geekiness.

asciinema project is built of several sub-projects:

* command-line based terminal session recorder, `asciinema` ([source code](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema))
* asciinema.org - a website with an API ([source code](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server))
* javascript player ([source code](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player))

If technical details interest you then read more about
[how it works](/docs/how-it-works).

## A bit of history

asciinema project was started by [Marcin Kulik](https://asciinema.org/~sickill)
([@sickill](https://twitter.com/sickill)) in the beginning of 2011 as ascii.io.
He was playing with the idea of sharing terminal session recordings on the web
since 2010 but the working prototype came to life a bit later.  asciinema.org
site had a first public release in March 2012 (as ascii.io then).  The project
was renamed to "asciinema" in September 2013.

asciinema is actively developed with the help of great open
source [contributors](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server/contributors).

## Reporting bugs

As the service is built of several parts there are separate bug trackers:

* [github.com/asciinema/asciinema/issues](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/issues) - for recorder issues
* [github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server/issues](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server/issues) - for website/embedding issues
* [github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player/issues](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player/issues) - for player issues

Please only use them for reporting bugs. Do not ask for general help there. Use
[Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/asciinema/discussions) or IRC for
that.
