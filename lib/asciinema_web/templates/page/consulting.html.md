# asciinema consulting services

Hello there! Marcin from asciinema here.

I offer consulting services for asciinema project, which bring over a decade of
experience in building and refining solutions for terminal session recording,
sharing and streaming. Whether you're looking to integrate asciinema into your
infrastructure or website, to customize it to suit your specific needs, or to
create something new in this space, I'm happy to help.

I work with enterprises, startups and individuals.

## Services

Non-exhaustive list of services for asciinema:

- integration of [asciinema player](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player) in your website,
- building customized version of [asciinema player](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player) to suit your needs,
- integration of [asciinema recorder](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema) in your software solutions,
- installation and adaptation of [asciinema server](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server) to your infrastructure (on-premise, in the cloud),
- long term support for [asciinema server](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server) (upgrades),
- embedding of [asciinema virtual terminal](https://github.com/asciinema/avt) in your software,
- adaptation of [asciinema gif generator](https://github.com/asciinema/agg) to different input or output format.

With 20 years of professional experience I also help with topics beyond
asciinema (although slightly related):

- SSH session recording (e.g. for auditing),
- designing efficient binary network protocols tailored towards real-time use-cases and low-latency interactivity,
- identifying causes of software bloat/slowness, optimizing the heck out of it.

Happy to discuss other topics as well.

## Examples

Here are a few specific examples of what I do:

- WASM-powered session playback - see my [4x smaller, 50x faster](https://blog.asciinema.org/post/smaller-faster/) post.
- automatic recording and uploading: setting up asciinema recorder on servers,
  VMs or workstations to automatically record and upload employees' SSH sessions
  to your asciinema server instance or other storage location. Ideal for training,
  troubleshooting, and maintaining compliance.
- session live streaming: similar to the above but with ability to watch sessions in
  real-time, as they happen. Also great for training and presentations, allowing
  for immediate feedback and collaboration.
- full text search: automatic scanning of recorded sessions for undesired
  content like use of certain command-line tools or accidental exposure of
  secrets.
- playback of [custom recording
  formats](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player/tree/develop/src/parser#readme):
  extending asciinema player to allow replaying textual or binary log files.
- SSO for asciinema server: implementing Single Sign-On to ensure secure and convenient access to your
  asciinema server instance. SAML, Google Workspace, Azure AD, Auth0, and more.
- CI/CD integration: embedding asciinema recorder in your CI/CD pipeline to make
  debugging build failures easier. Possible thanks to additional timing
  information session recording files bring over regular log files.
- bare-metal optimizations for Elixir/Erlang codebases: identifying slow parts,
  rewriting them in Rust and integrating as NIFs (Rustler).
