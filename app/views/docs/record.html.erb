# Getting started

## 1. Install recorder

### Linux

To install/update ascii.io recorder, open a terminal and run following
command:

    $ curl -sL get.ascii.io | bash

### OSX (via Homebrew)

Install with:

    $ brew install https://raw.github.com/gist/3875486/asciiio.rb --HEAD

Later update with:

    $ brew upgrade asciiio

### OSX (no Homebrew)

If you don't use Homebrew then install/update with:

    $ curl -sL get.ascii.io | bash

## 2. Record

Open your terminal and run following command:

    $ asciiio

New shell instance will be opened and everything you'll do in it will be
recorded. When you're ready to upload simply exit the shell with `exit`
command or just hit `<C-d>`.

## 3. Create profile (optional)

If you want your recordings to be assigned to your ascii.io profile and to be
able to edit/delete them run this and follow instructions:

    $ asciiio auth

If you skip this step now, you can always run above command later and all
previously recorded asciicasts will get automatically assigned to your new
profile.

Btw, see [my profile](/~sickill).

## Advanced options

The recorder supports several command-line options. See
[here](<%= docs_path(:options) %>) for details.
