  ## 2. Record

  Go to your terminal and run the following command:

      asciinema rec

  New shell will be spawned and everything you do in it will get recorded.
  When you're ready to finish simply exit the shell either by typing `exit` or
  hitting <kbd>Ctrl-D</kdb>.

  See [usage instructions](#{docs_path(:usage)}) to learn about all commands and options.

  ## 3. Create your profile (optional)

  If you want your recordings to be assigned to your asciinema profile run the
  following command:

      asciinema auth

  If you skip this step now, you can run the above command later and all
  previously recorded asciicasts will automatically get assigned to your
  profile.

  NOTE: To be able to edit/delete your recordings you have to assign them to
  your profile.
