  <p>I’ve been doing some reflecting this week on how I can work smarter (instead of harder), and one of the things I came up with was adding a few more tools to my Vim repertoire. I spend more than half of my engineering time in Vim (the other half usually being in a web browser), so I figured that a few minutes here and there would eventually add up in a big way.</p>
  <p>But like anything else with Vim, there are always multiple ways of accomplishing the very same thing, so I make no guarantees that there aren’t simpler ways of getting this done — but I can say that this way gets the job done, and is pretty easy to get working on your own system.</p>
