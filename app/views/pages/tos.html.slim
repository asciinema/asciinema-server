  If you create a user account on the Website, you are responsible for
  maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for
  all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in
  connection with the account. You must not describe or assign keywords to your

  ## Responsibility of Contributors

  If you operate an account, post material to the Website, post links on the
  Website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material
  available by means of the Website (any such material, "Content"), You are
  entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that
  Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question
  constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. By making
  Content available, you represent and warrant that:

  * the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the
    proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent,
    trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;
  * if your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have
    either (i) received permission from your employer to post or make available
    the Content, including but not limited to any software, or (ii) secured
    from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;
  * you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the
    Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to
    end users any required terms;
  * the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan
    horses or other harmful or destructive content;
  * the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does
    not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive
    traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third
    party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead
    recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);
  * the Content is not pornographic, does not contain threats or incite
    violence, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third
    party;
  * your account or recording is not getting advertised via unwanted
    electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, other
    blogs and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods;
  * your account or recording is not named in a manner that misleads your
    readers into thinking that you are another person or company. For example,
    your account’s or recording's URL or name is not the name of a person other
    than yourself or company other than your own; and
  * you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately
    categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the
    materials, whether requested to do so by Asciinema or otherwise.

  By submitting Content to Asciinema for inclusion on the Website, you grant
  Asciinema a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce,
  modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying,
  distributing and promoting your profile and/or recordings. If you delete
  Content, Asciinema will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Website,
  but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made
  immediately unavailable.

  Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Asciinema has
  the right (though not the obligation) to, in Asciinema’s sole discretion (i)
  refuse or remove any content that, in Asciinema’s reasonable opinion,
  violates any Asciinema policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or
  (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Website to any individual or
  entity for any reason, in Asciinema’s sole discretion. Asciinema will have
  no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.

  ## Responsibility of Website Visitors

  horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Website may contain

  website or webpage, Asciinema does not represent or imply that it endorses
  such website or webpage. You are responsible for taking precautions as

  infringes (once or repeatedly) the copyrights or other intellectual property
  rights of Asciinema or others, Asciinema may, in its sole discretion,

  termination, Asciinema will have no obligation to provide a refund of any
